# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Adding Topics to Your Repository

Topics are **NOT** in Settings. They're on the **main repository page**.

### Steps to Add Topics:

1. **Go to your repository's main page** (not Settings)
   - Click on the repository name in the top navigation
   - Or navigate to: `https://github.com/yourusername/kyc-docx-mcp-191125`

2. **Find the Topics section**
   - Look below the repository description
   - You'll see a section that says "About" with a gear icon (⚙️)
   - Click the gear icon next to "Topics"

3. **Add topics**
   - Type each topic and press Enter
   - Suggested topics:
     - `kyc`
     - `document-extraction`
     - `mcp`
     - `model-context-protocol`
     - `openai`
     - `gpt-5.1`
     - `typescript`
     - `compliance`
     - `financial-services`
     - `mexican-documents`

4. **Save** - Topics are saved automatically

## Alternative: Edit Repository Description

While you're on the main repository page:

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to the repository description
2. Add a clear description:
   ```

   ```
